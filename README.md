# StaticPage
Using Bootstrap Classes and a bit of java script and Jquery to build a static page.
Intially Built this to use as a template for my personal Website Then i had a baby and i was gone for 9 months. Time to get back at it.

# Things i Need on my Site
* Animations 
* Responsive flows
* Intaractions (add some games and such)
* Front end Logic
